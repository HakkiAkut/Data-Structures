     * Secondly method will check is player in finish point (player can't be finish point in starting point) if it is, then will print path and return(method ends)
     * then it will check where player came from so player won't move to this direction(if it comes from right won't move to left)
     * after that method will check is player in left border(is x==0) if it's not then will check is there(left side) any obstacle and was player visit this tile previously
     * if it's not then player will move to left side (x-1) and call findPath() method(recursion) after called method ends,it will reset player position.
     * After that it will do this process for right border(is x==width-1), top border(is y==0) and bottom border(y==height-1) respectively,
     * So it will check every possible moves(with no repetition) and try this paths.
     * After this operations method will end(if it is the child call then it will return to parent basically)
     * So in the end it will check every possible move which is no tile is revisited.
